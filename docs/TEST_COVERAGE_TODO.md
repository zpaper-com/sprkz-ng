- ‚úÖ **`pdfService.ts`**: 43.42% ‚Üí 100% (Complete PDF processing coverage)
- ‚úÖ **`formFieldService.ts`**: 65.21% ‚Üí 79.44% (34 comprehensive tests added)
- **Total test cases added**: 50+ comprehensive tests
- **Achievement**: All critical components now meet TDD requirements

### Phase 2: UI Components (Next - 3 weeks)
- Focus on PDF and form components
- Target: Bring main UI components to 80% coverage
- Estimated effort: 60-80 test cases

### Phase 2: UI Components (3 weeks)
- Focus on PDF and form components
- Target: Bring main UI components to 80% coverage
- Estimated effort: 60-80 test cases

### Phase 3: Admin & Mobile (2 weeks)
- Complete admin interface and mobile component testing
- Target: Achieve overall 80% project coverage
- Estimated effort: 30-40 test cases

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Component:
1. **Setup**: Create test file with proper mocks
2. **Happy Path**: Test normal functionality
3. **Error Cases**: Test error handling and edge cases
4. **Integration**: Test component interactions
5. **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen readers
6. **Performance**: Test with large datasets or complex operations

### Mock Strategy:
- Mock external dependencies (PDF.js, databases, APIs)
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Jest for service and utility tests
- Mock DOM APIs and browser features consistently

### Coverage Validation:
```bash
# Run coverage for specific component
npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern=componentName

# Check if component meets target coverage
npm test -- --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"statements":80}}'
```

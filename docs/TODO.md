- **Code Quality**: Maintain ESLint clean, Prettier formatted, TypeScript strict compliance

## Quality Gates

Before moving to the next phase, ensure:
- ✅ All functionality working as specified
- ✅ No critical bugs or regressions
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility verified
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passing with no warnings
- ✅ Unit tests passing with >80% coverage

/**
 * Use this integration to set up Sentry with web workers.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This integration must be added **before** you start listening to
 * any messages from the worker. Otherwise, your message handlers will receive
 * messages from the Sentry SDK which you need to ignore.
 *
 * This integration only has an effect, if you call `Sentry.registerWorker(self)`
 * from within the worker(s) you're adding to the integration.
 *
 * Given that you want to initialize the SDK as early as possible, you most likely
 * want to add this integration **after** initializing the SDK:
 *
 * @example:
 * ```ts filename={main.js}
 * import * as Sentry from '@sentry/<your-sdk>';
 *
 * // some time earlier:
 * Sentry.init(...)
 *
 * // 1. Initialize the worker
 * const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.ts', import.meta.url));
 *
 * // 2. Add the integration
 * const webWorkerIntegration = Sentry.webWorkerIntegration({ worker });
 * Sentry.addIntegration(webWorkerIntegration);
 *
 * // 3. Register message listeners on the worker
 * worker.addEventListener('message', event => {
 *  // ...
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If you initialize multiple workers at the same time, you can also pass an array of workers
 * to the integration:
 *
 * ```ts filename={main.js}
 * const webWorkerIntegration = Sentry.webWorkerIntegration({ worker: [worker1, worker2] });
 * Sentry.addIntegration(webWorkerIntegration);
 * ```
 *
 * If you have any additional workers that you initialize at a later point,
 * you can add them to the integration as follows:
 *
 * ```ts filename={main.js}
 * const webWorkerIntegration = Sentry.webWorkerIntegration({ worker: worker1 });
 * Sentry.addIntegration(webWorkerIntegration);
 *
 * // sometime later:
 * webWorkerIntegration.addWorker(worker2);
 * ```
 *
 * Of course, you can also directly add the integration in Sentry.init:
 * ```ts filename={main.js}
 * import * as Sentry from '@sentry/<your-sdk>';
 *
 * // 1. Initialize the worker
 * const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.ts', import.meta.url));
 *
 * // 2. Initialize the SDK
 * Sentry.init({
 *  integrations: [Sentry.webWorkerIntegration({ worker })]
 * });
 *
 * // 3. Register message listeners on the worker
 * worker.addEventListener('message', event => {
 *  // ...
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @param options {WebWorkerIntegrationOptions} Integration options:
 *   - `worker`: The worker instance.

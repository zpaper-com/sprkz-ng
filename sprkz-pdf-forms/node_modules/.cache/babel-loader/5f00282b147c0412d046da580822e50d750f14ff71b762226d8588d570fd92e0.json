The\n * default threshold is `40`, which means INP scores of less than 40 will not\n * be reported. To avoid reporting no interactions in these cases, the library\n * will fall back to the input delay of the first interaction. Note that this\n * will not affect your 75th percentile INP value unless that value is also\n * less than 40 (well below the recommended\n * [good](https://web.dev/articles/inp#what_is_a_good_inp_score) threshold).\n *\n * If the `reportAllChanges` configuration option is set to `true`, the\n * `callback` function will be called as soon as the value is initially\n * determined as well as any time the value changes throughout the page\n * lifespan.\n *\n * _**Important:** INP should be continually monitored for changes throughout\n * the entire lifespan of a pageâ€”including if the user returns to the page after\n * it's been hidden/backgrounded. However, since browsers often [will not fire\n * additional callbacks once the user has backgrounded a\n * page](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/page-lifecycle-api/#advice-hidden),\n * `callback` is always called when the page's visibility state changes to\n * hidden. As a result, the `callback` function might be called multiple times\n * during the same page load._\n */\nconst onINP = (onReport, opts = {}) => {\n  // Return if the browser doesn't support all APIs needed to measure INP.\n  if (!(globalThis.PerformanceEventTiming && 'interactionId' in PerformanceEventTiming.prototype)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  whenActivated(() => {\n    // TODO(philipwalton): remove once the polyfill is no longer needed.\n    initInteractionCountPolyfill();\n    const metric = initMetric('INP');\n    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const\n    let report;\n    const interactionManager = initUnique(opts, InteractionManager);\n    const handleEntries = entries => {\n      // Queue the `handleEntries()` callback in the next idle task.\n      // This is needed to increase the chances that all event entries that\n      // occurred between the user interaction and the next paint\n      // have been dispatched.
